**Info Source Mod** 
Encrypt Max Code is useful for encrypting the cleo source code for those of you who often make Cleo mods so that no one steals your code

**How it works**
That is, you need to disable "Add extra info to SCM" in Sanny Builder settings, if not, then your CLEO code encryption is useless, back to the topic, if so you need to compile it
